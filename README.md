# nmtan/chevereto - Chevereto Free Docker

[Chevereto][cheveretourl] is a powerful and fast image hosting script that allows you to create your very own full featured image hosting website in just minutes.

Please note that the `installer` tag will provide you with the installer script
from Chevereto, which can be used to install either the [free Chevereto version][cheveretogithub]
or the paid version, while all the other tags will only provide the [free version][cheveretogithub].

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

> Here we list only the most relevant and recent tags, for the full list, please
use the `tags` tab in [Dockerhub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/nmtan/chevereto)

* `latest` - Using latest release from [original repo][cheveretogithub] ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/tanmng/docker-chevereto/blob/master/latest/Dockerfile))
* `1.6.2`, `1.6.1`, `1.6.0`, `1.5.1`, `1.5.0`, `1.4.2`, `1.4.1`, `1.4.0`, `1.3.0`, `1.2.3` corresponds to the releases from [original repo][cheveretogithub] ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/tanmng/docker-chevereto/blob/master/latest/Dockerfile))


> Note on PHP version: [Chevereto](cheveretourl) added support for PHP 7.4 since release `1.3.0`, PHP 7.3 since release `1.2.0`, PHP 7.2 since release `1.1.0`, and support for PHP 7.1 since release `1.0.6`, thus, the Docker images use the appropriate version of PHP to ensure the best performance and stability. You can check the [images' labels](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) (by running `docker image inspect IMAGE_NAME`) for this information.

> Some older tag of Chevereto are no longer supported to save up on build resources

## Environment variables

Similar to other Docker images, this image strive to allow users to customize their service. In earlier releases, we had to add [`settings.php`](https://github.com/tanmng/docker-chevereto/blob/master/settings.php) to the image to introduce these settings. From release `1.6.1`, [Rodolfo Berrios](http://rodolfoberrios.com/) included [`settings-env.php`](https://github.com/rodber/chevereto-free/blob/1.6/app/settings-env.php) which takes care of this capability. Also, he added some env-var to help users customize the application even more. Please check out the file for further details

## Essential env-var - available in all versions

The most essentials environments variables are listed below

* `CHEVERETO_DB_HOST` - Hostname of the Database machine that you wish to connect.
* `CHEVERETO_DB_PORT` - The port of the Database machine to connect to, default to `3306`.
* `CHEVERETO_DB_USER` - Username to authenticate to MySQL database.
* `CHEVERETO_DB_PASS` - Password of the user when connect to MySQL database.
* `CHEVERETO_DB_NAME` - Name of the database in MySQL server.
* `CHEVERETO_DB_PREFIX` - Table prefix (you can use this to run multiple instance of Chevereto using the same Database), default to `chv_`.

> Previously, we use `CHEVERETO_DB_USERNAME` instead of `CHEVERETO_DB_USER` and `CHEVERETO_DB_PASSWORD` instead of `CHEVERETO_DB_PASS`. Both of these types of env-vars will work. See the explanation below.

> Starting from version `1.6.1`, Chevereto Free supports env-var `CHEVERETO_DB_USER` and `CHEVERETO_DB_PASS` to specify the username + password to connect to database server. Because of that, I updated this Docker image to use the same env-var to be consistent with upstream. You can still use `CHEVERETO_DB_USERNAME` and `CHEVERETO_DB_PASSWORD` for these purposes, but the Docker container will display warning messages about this. Except from that, you use either type of env-var without any issues.

> For other environment variables, please consult the file [`settings.php`](https://github.com/tanmng/docker-chevereto/blob/master/settings.php) and the section "Advanced configuration" below.

## Additional en-vars, Version 1.6 and up

* `CHEVERETO_DB_DRIVER` - DB driver, defaults to `mysql`
* `CHEVERETO_DB_PDO_ATTRS` - Additional attributes to the PDO driver used by PHP to connect to database server (see [PDO documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php))
* `CHEVERETO_DEBUG_LEVEL` - Debug level, has to be a string that converts to int value - see [instruction on debug](https://chevereto-free.github.io/manual/troubleshooting/debug.html#debug) fur details
* `CHEVERETO_HOSTNAME` - Set the path of the application, instead of relying on `$_SERVER` special variable in PHP.
* `CHEVERETO_HOSTNAME_PATH` - Set the domain name (and path) of the application, instead of relying on `$_SERVER` special variable in PHP.
* `CHEVERETO_HTTPS` - Force user to use HTTPS (by redirection) when using Chevereto, the env-var will be converted to boolean
* `CHEVERETO_IMAGE_FORMATS_AVAILABLE` - A Json-encoded list of image formats that you wish to allow on the server.
* Some others: `CHEVERETO_DISABLE_PHP_PAGES`, `CHEVERETO_DISABLE_UPDATE_HTTP`, `CHEVERETO_DISABLE_UPDATE_CLI`, `CHEVERETO_ERROR_LOG`, `CHEVERETO_IMAGE_LIBRARY`, `CHEVERETO_SESSION_SAVE_HANDLER`, `CHEVERETO_SESSION_SAVE_PATH`

## Connection to database

[Chevereto][cheveretourl] requires an Mysql database to store its information. You can use a [Mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) or [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) container to host this.

Information on connection to database is provided to container via environment variables explained above.

## Persistent storage

[Chevereto][cheveretourl] stores images uploaded by users in `/var/www/html/images` directory within the container.

You can mount a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#data-volumes) at this location to ensure that you don't lose your images if you relaunch/remove container.

Please note that inside the container, Chevereto runs as user `www-data` (UID: 33, GID: 33). So the permission of the volume must allow this user (with this UID) write access. Consequentially, that means if you bind mount a directory into the image to use as `images`, you will have to correct the ownership of that directory for the application to work.

## Max image size

By default, PHP allow a maximum file upload to be 2MB. You can change such behaviour by updating the `php.ini` in your container, either by bind-mount the file, or build a new image with the updated file, that way you can reuse the image on demand.

> Note that by default, Chevereto set a file upload limit of 10MB, so after you modify your `php.ini`, you should also update this settings in Chevereto settings page (available at CHEVERETO_URL/dashboard/settings/image-upload)

> The customized `php.ini` should set the values of `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size` and potentially `memory_limit`, as showed in [the discussion from Chevereto Forum](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-supports-only-2mb-max-upload-size.4729/). Further details on these parameters are available from [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php)

An example of this is available in the [`examples/bigger-files` directory](examples/bigger-files)

## Example Usage

I recommend you to use [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) / [Docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) to launch Chevereto in conjunction with a MySQL database. A sample of docker-compose.yaml can be found below.

### Docker compose

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mariadb
    volumes:
      - database:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    restart: always
    networks:
      - private
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: chevereto_root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: chevereto
      MYSQL_USER: chevereto
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: chevereto

  chevereto:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: nmtan/chevereto
    restart: always
    networks:
      - private
    environment:
      CHEVERETO_DB_HOST: db
      CHEVERETO_DB_USERNAME: chevereto
      CHEVERETO_DB_PASSWORD: chevereto
      CHEVERETO_DB_NAME: chevereto
      CHEVERETO_DB_PREFIX: chv_
    volumes:
      - chevereto_images:/var/www/html/images:rw
    ports:
      - 8080:80

networks:
  private:
volumes:
  database:
  chevereto_images:
```

Once `docker-compose.yaml` is ready, you can run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To start the service and access Cheverto at `localhost:8080`

## Note on multi platform

It is feasible to run a Docker container image on different architectures. For now, I don't yet have the time to work on this, but will make sure to include that in future releases.

## Contributions

For now, this project is being maintained solely by me, for any questions or suggestions of improvements, please feel free [to reach out](mailto:tan.mng90@gmail.com)

## License

The docker image is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE)

Please note that [Chevereto](cheveretourl) is a product of [Rodolfo Berrios](http://rodolfoberrios.com/), this project aims mainly at encapsulating the free version (released under AGPL v3 License) into a Docker container image, which can then be used easily.
